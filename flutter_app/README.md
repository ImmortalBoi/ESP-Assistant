Flutter Mobile Application for IoT Control and Monitoring using ESP32.

## Getting Started

This project aims to design and implement a smart IoT system that integrates the ESP32 microcontroller with a Flutter-based mobile application. The ESP32 chip is responsible for connecting physical sensors and actuators (such as temperature sensors, motion detectors, relays, or LEDs) to the internet via Wi-Fi. The Flutter mobile application serves as the user interface, allowing real-time monitoring and control of connected devices.

The app provides features such as device status visualization, sensor data display (temperature, humidity, etc.), and control options (turning devices on/off). It communicates with the ESP32 through protocols like HTTP, MQTT, or WebSockets to ensure reliable data exchange. The system is designed to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly, making it suitable for applications in smart homes, energy management, and remote monitoring.

By combining Flutter’s cross-platform development capabilities with the ESP32’s IoT features, this project demonstrates the integration of hardware and software to create an efficient, practical, and modern IoT solution.
